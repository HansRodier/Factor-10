# Factor-10
# The goal of Factor-10 is to to achieve a worldwide reduction of use of resources by factor 10 within ten years on base of 2021 
# The first step of this proyect is to create and maintain an opensource database about resources used to produce and transport any good from food (apple, salami, pizza ...) to mobile phone, car etc. 
# The second step is to create an app/web/frontend so that everybody can check the resources used. Imagine you scan the barcode of a can of beer in the supermarket and the app shows how much water, energy, CO2, etc was used to produce it .
#
# Next steps could be to determinate the available resources per person and region in the world and people who commit not to use more than X% of their yearly available resources.
