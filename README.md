# Factor-10
# The goal of Factor-10 is to to achieve a worldwide reduction of use of resources by factor 10 within ten years on base of 2021 
# The first step of this proyect is to create and maintain an opensource database about resources used to produce, transport and -in case of- return or recycle  any good from food (apple, salami, pizza ...) to mobile phone, car etc. 
# The second step is to create an app/web/frontend so that everybody can check the resources used. Imagine you scan the barcode of a can or bottle of beer in the supermarket and the app shows how much water, energy, CO2, etc you use.
#
# Next steps could be to determinate the available resources per person and region in the world and people who commit not to use more than X% of their yearly available resources.
